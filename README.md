## Definition of Audience
Beer drinking community, specifically focused on fans of Untappd or other beer tracking apps.

## Definition Statement
I want to build a website that searches the current availability of seasonal beers.

## Elevator Pitch
I was at a late night movie screening, and a couple acquaintances were going to order a beer. Three times the discussion had "I don't know if that's available right now". A light bulb went off and I realized that not all seasonal beer is released at the same time. For example, Schlafly's pumpkin was released in August but breweries like Ferguson won't release their pumpkin until September. It would be nice to have a resource that will search and find if a particular brewery had released a particular seasonal style.

## Outline of Content
